    <p>A sound separation system aims to extract a clean recording of a single target sound (e.g. the vocalist) from a
    recording containing a mixture of several sounds (e.g. the rest of the band). This listening test aims to rate the
    quality of recordings produced by different sound separation systems. Due to imperfections of each sound separation
    system, the output recording (e.g. vocals extracted from the mixture) may include several types of degradations
    compared to the clean target sound&mdash;it might be a little distorted, you still might be able to hear the
    background (a little or a lot), it might have strange artifacts.</p>

    <p>During the test, you will be asked to assess the quality of the audio. The test will have two main parts:
    1) a training phase and 2) an evaluation phase. During the training phase, you will have to listen to all the
    recordings and learn the range of quality that is possible. During the evaluation phase, you will have to rate
    the quality of eight test recordings compared to the perfect target sound.</p>

    <p>The expected total duration of the test is 5 minutes.</p>

    <p>However, if this is your first HIT in this group, there will also be additional surveys and hearing tests, which
    will increase the expected total duration of the first HIT is 8 minutes. Because this first HIT takes longer than
    the rest of the HITs in this group, you will be given a $0.30 bonus.</p>
